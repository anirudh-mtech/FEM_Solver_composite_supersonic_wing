# FEM_Solver_composite_supersonic_wing
1. The solver can be used for any dimensions, sweep, material, angle of each ply, and thickness of each ply and is written purely on MATLAB.
2. Run time for each main section of code is around 2-3 minutes hence the entire process can be completed in 10-15 minutes.
3. Convergence is around 0.001 and displacements are reasonable.
4. The displacements can be extrapolated to find stress, strain, failure criteria.
